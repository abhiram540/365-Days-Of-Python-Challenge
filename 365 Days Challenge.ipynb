    "\n",
    "In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;\n",
    "- if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 ÷ 2;\n",
    "- otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 × c0 + 1;\n",
    "- if c0 ≠ 1, skip to point 2.\n",
    "The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural number (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers. Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as c0 remains different from 1. We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal. Your code should output all the intermediate values of c0, too.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: the most important part of the problem is how to transform Collatz's idea into a while loop - this is the key to success."

    "### Day 11: Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sorting algorithms have been invented so far, which differ a lot in speed, as well as in complexity. We are going to show you a very simple algorithm, easy to understand, but unfortunately not too efficient, either. It's used very rarely, and certainly not for large and extensive lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that a list can be sorted in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- increasing (or more precisely - non-decreasing) - if in every pair of adjacent elements, the former element is not greater than the latter;\n",
    "- decreasing (or more precisely - non-increasing) - if in every pair of adjacent elements, the former element is not less than the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we'll sort the list in increasing order, so that the numbers will be ordered from the smallest to the largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "**8 10 6 2 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll try to use the following approach: we'll take the first and the second elements and compare them; if we determine that they're in the wrong order (i.e., the first is greater than the second), we'll swap them round; if their order is valid, we'll do nothing. A glance at our list confirms the latter - the elements 01 and 02 are in the proper order, as in 8 < 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at the second and the third elements. They're in the wrong positions. We have to swap them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**8 <span style='color:red'>6 10</span> 2 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "We go further, and look at the third and the fourth elements. Again, this is not what it's supposed to be like. We have to swap them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**8 6 <span style='color:red'>2 10</span> 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we check the fourth and the fifth elements. Yes, they too are in the wrong positions. Another swap occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**8 6 2 <span style='color:red'>4 10</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first pass through the list is already finished. We're still far from finishing our job, but something curious has happened in the meantime. The largest element, 10, has already gone to the end of the list. Note that this is the desired place for it. All the remaining elements form a picturesque mess, but this one is already in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for a moment, try to imagine the list in a slightly different way - namely, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**10<br>\n",
    "4<br>\n",
    "2<br>\n",
    "6<br>\n",
    "8**\n",
    "\n",
    "Look - 10 is at the top. We could say that it floated up from the bottom to the surface, just like the bubble in a glass of champagne. The sorting method derives its name from the same observation - it's called a bubble sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we start with the second pass through the list. We look at the first and second elements - a swap is necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style='color:red'>6 8</span> 2 4 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for the second and third elements: we have to swap them too:\n",
    "\n",
    "**6 <span style='color:red'>2 8</span> 4 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the third and fourth elements, and the second pass is finished, as 8 is already in place:\n",
    "\n",
    "**6 2 <span style='color:red'>4 8</span> 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the next pass immediately. Watch the first and the second elements carefully - another swap is needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style='color:red'>2 6</span> 4 8 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now 6 needs to go into place. We swap the second and the third elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 4 6 8 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "The list is already sorted. We have nothing more to do. This is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the essence of this algorithm is simple: we compare the adjacent elements, and by swapping some of them, we achieve our goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's code in Python all the actions performed during a single pass through the list, and then we'll consider how many passes we actually need to perform it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many passes do we need to sort the entire list?\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve this issue in the following way: we introduce another variable; its task is to observe if any swap has been done during the pass or not; if there is no swap, then the list is already sorted, and nothing more has to be done. We create a variable named **swapped**, and we assign a value of **False** to it, to indicate that there are no swaps. Otherwise, it will be assigned **True**."
